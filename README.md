# WASM TOOLS

[wasm.vaibhavraj.dev](https://wasm.vaibhavraj.dev/)

A collection of small tools that I usually use for minor tasks with video or audio media.

> Please suggest video or audio tools you might need! I'll try my best to add more such tools.

Features:
- [x] Video to GIF converter
- [x] Audio Extractor

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
